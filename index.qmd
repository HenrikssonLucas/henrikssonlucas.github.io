Hi!

I am a second-year PhD student at the [Stockholm School of Economics](https://www.hhs.se/). I am also an affiliated researcher at the [Research Group for Socioeconomic Studies of Technology](https://soetech.org/) at Lund University.

Feel free to reach out via email at [lucas.henriksson@hhs.se](mailto:lucas.henriksson@hhs.se).

## Research

My research interests are primarily in labor and public economics. Specifically, I'm interested in understanding how social security systems and taxation shape individual choices. Currently, I am mostly working on ideas related to unemployment insurance in Sweden. 

## Policy Reports

### Den svenska välfärden möter den moderna världen – Klarar kommuner och regioner att finansiera välfärden i en global och digital ekonomi?

*Coauthored with [Åsa Hansson](https://portal.research.lu.se/sv/persons/%C3%A5sa-hansson). \[[Published by Ratio in 2025](https://cms.ratio.se/app/uploads/2025/04/rapport-35-den-svenska-valfarden-1.pdf)\]*

*Summary in English*: We analyzes the long-term sustainability of Sweden’s decentralized welfare model under growing fiscal pressure from demographic change, digitalization, and increased labor mobility. We examine the capacity of municipalities and regions to finance welfare services under a tax system dominated by local taxation of labor income. The report identifies structural weaknesses in the current financing model, including a shrinking and uneven local tax base, vertical tax externalities due to overlapping tax powers, and rising mobility of high-income earners. We discuss reforms to improve efficiency and long-term fiscal stability of the financing of local governments.
