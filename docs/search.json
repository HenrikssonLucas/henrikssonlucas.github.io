[Published by Ratio in 2025]\nSummary in English: We analyzes the long-term sustainability of Sweden’s decentralized welfare model under growing fiscal pressure from demographic change, digitalization, and increased labor mobility. We examine the capacity of municipalities and regions to finance welfare services under a tax system dominated by local taxation of labor income. The report identifies structural weaknesses in the current financing model, including a shrinking and uneven local tax base, vertical tax externalities due to overlapping tax powers, and rising mobility of high-income earners. We discuss reforms to improve efficiency and long-term fiscal stability of the financing of local governments."
