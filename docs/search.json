[Published in 2025]\nWe analyzes the long-term sustainability of Sweden’s decentralized welfare model under growing fiscal pressure from demographic change, digitalization, and increased labor mobility. We examine the capacity of municipalities and regions to finance welfare services under a tax system dominated by local taxation of labor income. The report identifies structural weaknesses in the current financing model, including a shrinking and uneven local tax base, vertical tax externalities due to overlapping tax powers, and rising mobility of high-income earners. We discuss alternative financing models and propose policy options such as introducing local property taxation, assigning new tax bases like natural resources to local governments, and reducing reliance on labor-based taxation to improve efficiency, equity, and long-term fiscal stability."

[Latest version: May 2023]\nThis was (one of) our master’s thesis, which was awarded the 2023 Scholarship for Student Thesis of the Year by the Institute for Health Economics (IHE) and the Bengt Jönsson Foundation for Health Economic Research.\n\nAbstract\nUsing data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey on smoking behaviors for roughly 440,000 European youths over the years 2001-2018, we show that a one euro increase in cigarette excise taxes reduces smoking prevalence (share of children who has smoked) by 2 percentage points using a two-way fixed effects model. This translates to a participation elasticity of -0.1, implying youths are less price sensitive than adults. This aligns with recent research which has questioned the previous consensus that youths are more price sensitive than adults. In line with similar research on American youths, we also show that the effect of cigarette taxes is decreasing over time and has had no significant effect when focusing on 2010-2018. For frequent smoking (once a week or more) we find no statistically significant effect for any time period, although this might be due to the fact that very few 11-15-year olds are regular smokers. We conclude that policymakers might have to consider other tools than taxation if they want to reduce youth smoking participation further."
